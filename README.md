# Why

Twitter has gotten a lot more aggressive with marking media as "sensitive" and there seems to be no way anymore to turn the warning off (as of 2024-04-06).
You have to click "Show" every single time you want to view a "sensitive" image or video.

# What

A user script for *monkey* type user script extensions that clicks "Show" for you.

# How

Import the script, idk.

# Compatibility

I only tested in Firefox 124.

I tested [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) and [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

I guess it also works for Greasemonkey etc, but haven't tested it.
